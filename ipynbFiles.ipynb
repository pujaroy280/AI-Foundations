There are different methods for bringing that code into a notebook, each more appropriate for different purposes.  While not rigid guidelines, the following tips can be useful in your decisions about which method to use:\n",

    "*Loading* Python code into a notebook using %load is useful if:\n",
    "* you want to display the code itself within the notebook (for example, to document what you've done)\n",
